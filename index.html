My favourite colours are blue, yellow and pink. I used to have 2 dogs before when I was staying with my family in Mississauga (sadly one passed away) and now i have 2 cats and 2 guinea pigs.

	<h1> About my life during covid</h1>
	<p>I think I can proudly annouce myself as a chef now since I have too many time to cook. I was planning to go back to vietnam before the airlines cancel all the flights but I was late and stuck here. Luckily I still have my boyfriend and 4 pets to survive through the boredom.</p>
	<h2> My pets</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Fish sause</li>

		 <p>She is an 8 years old Calico cat. I adopted her in February 2020 when i saw an ad on Kijiji said that she would be abandoned. She love attention but hate being petted if she did not lick your hand clean before you touch her. </p>
		<li>Ginger</li>

		 <p>He is a Siamese mix and according to what his old onwer told me I think he is around one and a half years old. he is super needy and very vocal. He would cry all night until I get up and oet him for like 3 hours and he can sleep through all daytime.</p>
		<li> Kar&Ma </li>
		  <div><img src="Kar&Ma.jpg"></div>
		  <p>They are my first pet right after I moved away from my family's city. They are suoer shy even now after I have them for 2 years but when they want food or hear the sound of me cutting vegies, they squeak like a fire alarm and would not stop until i give them food.</p>
