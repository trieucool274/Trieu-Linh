I'm living the South side of the country with all the culture spirit and friendly people. I lived in Canada for 3 years and this is my 2nd year in Fanshawe. I enjoy everything here in Canada despite the bizzard snow every winter, I used to take music industrial art for my career job but I recognize it's more like a hobby than work so I take Media design instead and receive a unforgetable experience from the very first assignment. I do photograph as well and cosplay photograph is one of my perspective. </p>
